N * Multibyte Character Functions.
N * The behaviour of the multibyte character functions is affected by the
N * LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. For a state-dependent encoding,
N * each function is placed into its initial state by a call for which its
N * character pointer argument, s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s
N * as other than a null pointer cause the internal state of the function to be
N * altered as necessary. A call with s as a null pointer causes these functions
N * to return a nonzero value if encodings have state dependency, and a zero
N * otherwise. After the LC_CTYPE category is changed, the shift state of these
N * functions is indeterminate.

N    * A sequence of calls to the strtok function breaks the string pointed to

N    * null pointer as their first argument. The separator string pointed to by
N    * s2 may be different from call to call.
N    * The first call in the sequence searches for the first character that is

N    * the current token extends to the end of the string pointed to by s1, and
N    * subsequent searches for a token will fail. If such a character is found,

N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.
